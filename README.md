# Multimodal deep learning for materials
Below are the two CNN Image Datasets Used in the Research. One is for the main research and the other for the generalization test.

Observe the format of how these folders are arranged. If you use your own image data, you must organize it in the same way. And you have to adjust the "directories" everywhere.

Here's a video which gives a demonstration and walkthrough of all the code and data to make it easier to implement. Watch it to get a better understanding of this repo.

# Paper 
The relevant paper is "A science directed progressive neural network for multimodal prediction of elastoplastic behavior in composite materials" published in Composites Part A. Please email me at dsaha36@gatech.edu or dhrubo.saha.117@gmail.com if you don't have access to the journal, and I will send you the paper.

# Note
This repository is currently outdated because the posted datasets and codes are from almost a year back, and many modifications and additions were made since. All the codes were also not uploaded. Before the end of July 2025, I will upload all the up-to-date code notebooks.
